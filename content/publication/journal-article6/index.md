abstract: Appreciative Inquiry (AI) is a practical framework for organizational development in social welfare practice, aiming to promote individual and organizational competencies. AI harnesses positive elements within organizations to enhance their strengths and capabilities. By leveraging positive factors within organizations, AI supports the continuous development of social welfare institutions from a strengths-based perspective and serves as a powerful model for driving effective and lasting organizational change.
