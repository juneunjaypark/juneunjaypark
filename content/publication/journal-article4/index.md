abstract: This study aimed to explore research trends and suggest future directions for preschoolers to children's emotions, social competence, and self-esteem through traditional game programs. A total of 87 papers from January 2007 to February 2022 were selected for text mining, 38 papers for reliability and validity analysis regarding research period, themes, subjects, and programs. The results were as follows (a) social competence showed the highest frequency in research themes, (b) elementary students (67.2%) and the preschool institutions and elementary schools (84.2%) were the most studied subjects and places, and (c) the major sessions of games were identified as 11-20 (57.9%). In the analysis of 5 types of traditional game programs, 'target hitting' represented the most effective for elevating emotions, social competence, and self-esteem. These findings indicate that associated variables, such as physical activity, creativity, and subjective well-being, need to be investigated as they seem to benefit early to middle childhood development. Furthermore, additional programs, tailored for low-income and multicultural families, should be developed to test the programsâ€™ effectiveness. Future research could consider implementing the most effective subjects and types of programs for further investigations.
