abstract: Objectives The purpose of this study is to identify the effectiveness of appreciative inquiry (AI) and how it can be applied to social welfare coursework. Ultimately, the present study aims to boost participatory learning, discover positive aspects of students, and enhance the capability of voluntary AI learning. Methods D University students (N = 34) participated in the 5-D model AI learning. Pre- and post-test was completed to evaluate the effectiveness of AI. Results The 5-D model (e.g., Define, Discovery, Dream, Design, and Desitny) with a single theme for each group appears to be the most desirable method for employing AI in social welfare coursework. Pre- and post-test reveals that the AI class effectiveness of individuals, teams, and team cooperation is augmented. Specifically, the individuals' positive psychological capital varaibles illustrate the highest (average .53 higher). Conclusions Results suggest that AI application in social welfare coursework may be effective for participatory learning and voluntary AI learning. To better implement AI in coursework, future research should consider developing systematic AI processes and objective evaluation tools based on the 5-D model, as well as exploring an action plan, a best practice, and positive questions corresponding to social welfare courses..
